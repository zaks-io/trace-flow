## 2026-05-25 — guide bootstrap — docs/agent-analytics-guide

**Status:** ✅ done
**Changed:** Created `docs/guides/agent-conversation-analytics/` with `README.md` (goal +
coordination protocol + dependency graph), `ROADMAP.md` (Phase 0–6 as 24 claimable tasks), and this
`CHANGELOG.md`. No feature code.
**Verified:** Markdown renders; every ROADMAP `depends-on` ID resolves; links to the ADR and
`CONTEXT.md` resolve.
**Next / blockers:** None. First wave is open — tasks **0a**, **0b**, **0c** have no dependencies and
can be claimed immediately.
