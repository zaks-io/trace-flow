# Issue Tracker Contract

Use this when writing the issue tracker section of
`docs/agents/workflow/config.md`. The configured tracker can be any provider the
repo uses.

## Default States

- `Triage`
- `Backlog`
- `Todo`
- `In Progress`
- `Blocked`
- `In Review`
- `Changes Requested`
- `Ready to Merge`
- `Done`
- `Canceled`
- `Duplicate`

## Default Labels

Kind (single-select; skills enforce exclusivity even if the tracker group does
not):

- `kind-spec`: holds spec or PRD prose; input to To Issues; never dispatched
- `kind-epic`: parent or workstream container; never dispatched
- `kind-slice`: one-PR implementation ticket; the only kind a worker runs

Kind is a separate axis from type. A `kind-slice` still carries one type label.
`ziw-to-issues` sets exactly one kind and clears any other `kind-*`.

Readiness:

- `needs-triage`
- `needs-info`
- `ready-for-agent`
- `ready-for-human`
- `wontfix`

Risk:

- `risk-normal`
- `risk-security-sensitive`
- `risk-schema`
- `risk-cross-cutting`

Review evidence:

- `Code review passed`

Type:

- `Bug`
- `Feature`
- `Improvement`
- `Tech Debt`
- `Spike`
- `Hotfix`

## Agent-Ready Issue Body

An issue is ready for Agent Implement only when it is scoped to one PR and
contains:

- outcome
- context docs
- likely files, packages, or artifacts
- in scope
- out of scope
- acceptance criteria
- required checks
- security, privacy, data, or operational invariants
- dependencies or blockers

## Label Treatment Rules

- Repo config owns the treatment policy for every readiness and worker
  environment label. The defaults below apply only when the repo has no
  different verified mapping.
- `ready-for-agent` means no further human refinement is needed before handing
  the issue to an implementation agent. The issue should be scoped to one PR and
  backed by a complete agent-ready body. It can be present while dependency
  blockers remain.
- A ready `kind-slice` should be in the configured ready state, usually `Todo`,
  unless config names a specific blocked-ready state. `Backlog` is future work,
  not the ready queue.
- `ready-for-agent` must be removed when an issue moves to the configured `Done`
  state. Done work is complete, not waiting for agent handoff.
- Issue Triage should make current tickets agent-ready and keep tracker state
  aligned with external reality. Its default scope is the configured ready state,
  usually `Todo`, plus active or PR-linked issues that need repair. It should
  not review `Backlog` or equivalent future-work states unless the user
  explicitly asks for backlog review.
- During requested intake cleanup, Issue Triage may move complete issues from
  configured intake states such as `Triage` to the configured ready state,
  usually `Todo`. Encode blockers separately; dependency blockers do not prevent
  intake-to-ready promotion. Do not promote `Backlog` by default.
- Startable implementation work is `Todo`, unblocked, labeled `ready-for-agent`,
  and has a complete agent-ready body.
- Issue-assigned agent work, when supported by the repo, uses the repo-configured
  worker environment label, routing field, or metadata the tracker integration
  needs to select the environment.
- Issue-assigned delegation also requires the configured repo-route label (such
  as `<org>/<repo>`) so the assigned agent can resolve which repository to clone.
  Treat a missing repo-route label as a hard block on delegation: heal it inline
  when the tracker team maps unambiguously to one repo, otherwise escalate
  `needs-info`.
- When the user explicitly chooses an issue-assigned worker path, Orchestrator or
  Issue Triage may add the configured worker environment label or field after
  verifying the issue identity, repo route, and environment approval criteria. Do
  not require dependencies to be clear just to apply the environment label.
- If a repo uses an extra label such as `remote-worker` or `remote-cursor`,
  record it in `docs/agents/workflow/config.md`; it is not a shared default.
- Labels are coordination signals. The issue tracker is the source of truth for
  workflow state. Issue Triage owns requested intake-to-ready promotion and
  verified stale-state reconciliation, such as marking linked merged PR work
  `Done`; when it marks work `Done`, it also clears `ready-for-agent`. Agent
  Orchestrator owns active workflow state unless the user explicitly says
  otherwise.
- `Code review passed` means the latest linked PR head SHA has passed the
  configured code review gate for this ticket. Apply it only with adjacent
  review evidence that names the PR URL and reviewed head SHA. Remove it when
  the PR head changes, blocking review findings appear, the linked PR changes,
  or the review evidence is missing or stale.
- Blocked work can keep `ready-for-agent`. Blocker relationships, body blockers,
  or workflow state stop scheduling; they do not redefine readiness metadata.
- Worker environment labels are approval and routing metadata. They do not say
  whether the issue needs human refinement, whether dependencies are done, or
  whether Orchestrator may start it now.
- Human setup, credentials, product judgment, provider approval, customer input,
  and ADR decisions use `ready-for-human` or `needs-info`.
- Dependency order should be encoded with tracker relationships when the
  provider supports them.
- Auth, bootstrap, claim, invitation, one-use grant, custody, or ownership
  tickets need explicit security invariants before they are marked ready:
  authenticated actor binding, tenant or resource scope, replay behavior, atomic
  consume or claim semantics, and concurrency checks.
- Parent or workstream issues are containers unless explicitly marked
  executable. `kind-spec` and `kind-epic` are containers: they are To Issues
  input and must never be dispatched to a worker or marked `ready-for-agent`.
  Only `kind-slice` tickets are startable implementation work.
- Backlog review is opt-in. Do not scan, rewrite, promote, or reprioritize
  backlog issues during default issue triage.

## Agent Suitability

Use task type and risk to decide whether a `kind-slice` should be delegated to
an implementation agent.

Good default agent work:

- documentation
- tests
- build, CI, and lint updates
- small refactors with clear local checks
- scoped bug fixes with reproduction steps or acceptance checks
- isolated UI changes with screenshots, target states, or exact copy

Default human-planning work:

- auth, authorization, PII, secrets, payments, or destructive data
- production incidents or production deploy decisions
- broad refactors and cross-repo changes
- deep domain behavior without clear acceptance criteria
- performance work without a benchmark
- tasks where learning, design judgment, or product ambiguity is central

External APIs, credentials, production access, or unclear domain behavior should
move a ticket to `needs-info` or `ready-for-human` unless the ticket states the
verification path clearly enough for an implementation worker.

## Tracker Metadata Verification

Setup must record query-safe tracker metadata for the configured scope:

- exact provider IDs, keys, or display names accepted by the tracker tool
- status field names used by the current tool, such as `status`, `state`, or
  `statusType`
- blocker and dependency relationship fields
- routing and readiness labels
- a read-only verification query that returns the expected issue set

Do not treat an empty tracker response as proof that no work exists until the
configured provider ID or query-safe name has been verified. Do not parse local
tool-result cache files when the tracker tool can answer directly.

Do not mutate a real implementation issue to test whether a delegation field,
agent name, or integration exists. Use read-only metadata, existing verified
config, provider docs, or a user-approved test issue.

## Orphan Rules

An orphan is a real issue that belongs in the workflow but is missing the project,
team, parent, route label, status, body contract, or dependency links that let
Agent Orchestrator reason about it.

- Route orphans when the correct project, team, parent, or label is directly
  evidenced by the issue, linked docs, PR, branch, or configured repo route.
- Leave ambiguous orphans in triage with `needs-info` or `ready-for-human`.
- Do not mark an orphan `ready-for-agent` until routing, body contract, and
  labels are correct. Encode blockers separately.
- Do not cancel or close an orphan only because it is stale.

## Creating Tracked Work From Docs

When turning roadmaps, specs, ADRs, or plans into issues:

- extract only explicit capabilities, decisions, constraints, deferred work, and
  dependencies
- create one-PR implementation slices
- group by the configured tracker location, milestone, and parent or workstream
  issue
- apply repo routing, type, risk, area, and readiness labels from config
- leave vague ideas un-ticketed until scope is clear

Do not invent product scope, create new risk levels or label taxonomies, or
paste secrets, customer data, signed URLs, credentials, or private logs into the
tracker.
