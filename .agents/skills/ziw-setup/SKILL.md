# Setup

Create or refresh the repo-local agent config used by the other skills. Run this
once per repo, then rerun it when the workflow may have changed or the user wants
to verify that the config is current. The output is a compact lookup table, not
a narrative doc.

Include stable values workflow agents need repeatedly: repo commands, tracker
IDs, labels, agent access, review gates, handoff shape, and safety rules.
Agents should query external systems to refresh live state, not to rediscover
these values. If a value cannot be verified during setup, record it as an
explicit unknown with the source that should verify it.

Shared workflow skills may be distributed as project skills, plugin or
marketplace, managed settings, user/global-only, or mixed mode. Record which
mode this repo actually uses. Project-scoped generated `ziw-*` copies are valid
when repo, remote, or cloud workers need the skills from a fresh clone; treat
them as vendored generated dependencies from `zaks-io/skills`, update them
mechanically, and do not hand-edit them in downstream repos.

Setup is a verification pass, not a best-effort note-taking pass. Every populated
config value that can change agent behavior must have current evidence from the
repo, tracker, code host, CI, agent integration, environment config, or explicit
user instruction. If the value is not verified, mark it `inferred` or move it to
`Unknowns`; do not present it as authoritative.

## Inputs

- Repo path to configure.
- Existing repo rules, CI, package scripts, issue tracker, and deploy docs.
- Any user-provided tracker, agent access, or environment constraints.

## Output File

Create or update:

- `docs/agents/workflow/config.md`

Treat this file as the repo's workflow lookup table. Keep it terse: values,
paths, commands, IDs, owners, and unknowns. Omit explanation, background, and
fields that do not apply.

Load these references when writing the config:

- [references/project-config.md](references/project-config.md) for the template
  and required sections
- [references/agent-workflow.md](references/agent-workflow.md) for role
  responsibilities and adapter minimums
- [references/issue-tracker-contract.md](references/issue-tracker-contract.md)
  for tracker states, labels, readiness, and issue body shape
- [references/operating-profile.md](references/operating-profile.md) for the
  active PR/preview cap default, the issue-assigned delegation and continuation
  mechanic, the repo-route precondition, and the merge-safety decision table
- [references/linear-cursor-example.md](references/linear-cursor-example.md) for
  a worked Linear + Cursor config to copy when the repo uses that stack
- [references/handoff.md](references/handoff.md) for cross-agent handoff shape

## Refresh Existing Config

If `docs/agents/workflow/config.md` already exists, read it before inspecting
anything else. Use it as the baseline for refresh:

- preserve verified stable values that still match current repo and tracker
  state
- re-verify every populated behavior-affecting field before leaving it
  authoritative; do not preserve a stale value just because it is already in the
  file
- re-run at least one read-only query against configured tracker IDs and
  query-safe names before trusting a project, team, board, or roadmap mapping
- check unknowns, stale timestamps, changed commands, renamed labels, moved
  projects, changed CI, changed worker delegation paths, and changed environment
  rules
- replace stale slugs or display names that return empty tracker results when a
  verified provider ID or canonical name resolves the same scope
- update only fields that are missing, stale, wrong, or newly verified
- do not erase explicit human decisions unless current evidence or the user
  contradicts them
- report what changed, what stayed verified, and what remains unknown

Do not regenerate the config from scratch when refreshing. The job is to detect
drift from the current config, then patch the lookup table.

## Verification Standard

Verify all populated workflow fields that setup writes or preserves:

- repo identity, default branch, branch prefix, package manager, lockfile, and
  command names from repo files and git metadata
- install, check, build, test, lint, smoke, preview, and generated-artifact
  commands from scripts, CI workflows, makefiles, justfiles, runbooks, or direct
  safe command execution
- issue tracker provider, location, team/project/board/roadmap, statuses,
  labels, priorities, estimate fields, relationships, issue templates, and query
  contracts with read-only tracker tool calls when tools are available
- code host default branch, branch protections, PR conventions, linked checks,
  and open PR query shape through git metadata, code host tools, or workflow
  files
- worker delegation paths, environment labels or fields, continuation paths, and
  remote worker delegation mechanics through tracker metadata, verified config,
  or explicit user instruction
- Claude, Codex, editor, and repo-local adapter paths by resolving files,
  symlinks, imports, and generated skill metadata from a clean path
- shared workflow skill distribution mode, source, lockfile, refresh command,
  project paths, symlink layout, plugin marketplace, and whether generated skill
  directories are committed dependencies, ignored local cache, or absent
- environment safety, deployment paths, hosted checks, preview rules, credential
  rules, and production approval rules from deployment config, CI, runbooks, or
  explicit user instruction

Do not run install, deploy, production mutation, expensive hosted actions, or
credentialed provider actions just to verify setup unless the user explicitly
approved that action. For those values, verify the command or path exists and
record execution as unknown or requiring approval.

Every unknown must name the missing value and the source or action that would
verify it. The final report must say whether any critical unknowns remain.

## Gather

Inspect files that exist:

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, editor or agent rules, and repo-local skills
- target repo's Claude Code integration config, `.claude/*`, and any repo-local
  agent, command, or skill directories that Claude should load
- `package.json`, lockfiles, Makefile, Justfile, turbo config, and CI workflows
- project status, roadmap, specs, ADRs, runbooks, and existing `docs/agents/*`
- existing agent label docs, such as `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`
- code host branch, default branch, PR, preview, and deploy workflows
- root `.coderabbit.yaml` when present, especially `reviews.auto_review`
- hosted review provider docs or app settings when CodeRabbit, Cursor Bugbot,
  or another PR review bot is enabled
- issue tracker provider, provider location, projects or boards, statuses,
  labels, issue templates, and existing issue examples by querying tracker tools
  when available
- environment files, deployment config, and service inventories

## Configure

Record:

- only verified stable values future workflow agents would otherwise have to
  find again
- a compact verification summary: date, scope, evidence sources, safe commands or
  read-only tool calls used, and unverified values
- repo identity, default branch, branch prefix, and PR conventions
- default-branch baseline health: current required-check state, known-red jobs
  with an `expected-red-until-<ticket>` note, and which job conclusion the
  post-merge check judges when an umbrella workflow contains a known-broken
  sibling job
- remote worker environment enforcement: whether repo hooks and gates actually
  install and run in each remote or cloud worker environment (installers often
  skip under a generic `CI=true`) and the exact pre-push gate that environment
  enforces; prompt-level instructions are not a substitute for an
  environment-enforced gate
- package manager and command table: install, full gate, focused checks, build,
  lint, typecheck, tests, smoke, generated artifacts, cache policy, CI env
  passthrough rules, and the exact coverage or secret-scan scopes that hosted
  checks enforce
- gate parity: the repo's CI required job should invoke the same single verify
  entrypoint the local hooks run, so a check added to CI is a check added
  locally by construction. Record the entrypoint command and the CI job that
  calls it. Flag any test, lint, coverage, format, or scan step that CI runs
  outside that entrypoint as a `config-gap` to fix in the repo, not a
  difference to document in prose
- issue tracker provider, provider location, project or board, routing label,
  triage scope, orphan policy, statuses, labels, kind label set
  (`kind-spec`, `kind-epic`, `kind-slice`) and its single-select policy,
  readiness label policy, worker environment label policy when present, startable
  work criteria (including `kind-slice` only), readiness-label query policy that
  excludes the configured done state, priority policy, estimate field, estimate
  scale, estimate policy, dependency policy, dependency graph mechanism, file
  footprint convention, issue body contract, agent-suitability policy for work
  types and risk,
  Issue Triage verified-state reconciliation authority, configured
  intake-to-ready promotion authority, explicit Linear Backlog promotion gate,
  and which workflow
  role owns active status transitions
- tracker tool query contract: exact provider IDs, query-safe names, status
  field names, relationship or blocker fields, pagination shape if relevant, and
  one read-only verification query or tool call that returned the expected scope
- code-host issue sync policy, including whether Linear advances ticket states
  from linked GitHub PR status and whether agents should assume synced state when
  both linked entities exist
- code-host PR attention labels the orchestrator applies when a PR needs human
  merge or input; `needs-human-merge` must mean the PR is merge-ready except for
  required human merge authority, while labels such as `needs-human-input` cover
  non-merge-ready questions or approvals
- supported worker delegation paths: `local-worktree`, `issue-assigned`, or both
- default worker path and capacity policy when the user or repo has a stable
  preference
- duplicate worker or PR detection policy for issue-assigned providers that can
  spawn more than one session for one dispatch
- autonomous-loop controls when the repo runs the orchestrator unattended:
  active PR/preview cap, cap count policy, preview-provider cap, stuck-worker
  timeout, attempt cap before the thrash circuit breaker, required checks that
  define green for the integrate gate, auto-merge risk tiers, merge method,
  post-merge preparation and check, the production deploy status check on the
  default-branch HEAD when the repo deploys on push, auto-Done integration
  behavior,
  single-ticket one-off mutation policy, verified-ready ticket-set policy,
  completely-blocked stop policy, friction intake provider, location, mode,
  visibility, agent create authority, review cadence, cleanup policy, and
  delivery metrics
- runtime loop and automation terminology for each supported adapter: Claude Code
  `/loop`, schedule, or wake-up timer; Codex automations, either cron
  automations or heartbeat automations; and which mechanism owns recurring
  Orchestrator ticks
- label source of truth: the live tracker metadata, tracker workflow settings,
  existing repo docs, or explicit user instruction used to verify label names
- label documentation policy: whether repo-local label docs exist, and whether
  they mirror this config or redirect agents back to it
- verified tracker metadata: lookup tool or query used, verification date, and
  exact provider IDs, URLs, or keys for teams, projects, boards, repos,
  milestones, roadmaps, statuses, labels, priorities, estimate fields and
  allowed values, and relationship types when the tracker exposes them
- agent access rules for local Codex, remote worker agents, Claude, and any
  repo-approved worker
- workflow skill distribution policy: project skills, plugin or marketplace,
  managed settings, user/global-only, or mixed; include installer source,
  lockfile, pinned tag or commit when required, refresh command, project skill
  paths, symlink layout, and whether generated local copies are committed
  dependencies or ignored cache
- issue-assigned agent notes when available: project-specific environment labels
  or fields, worker environment approval labels, delegation tool or field,
  verified agent IDs, direct-agent reply targets, continuation comment rules, and
  liveness signals, nudge-before-redelegate policy, and no-mutation probe policy
- Claude Code compatibility: the target repo's Claude Code integration source
  of truth, the agent markdown it imports, the repo-local agent, command, or
  skill paths symlinked there, and how those links were verified
- automation roles: To Issues, Issue Triage, Agent Orchestrator, Agent Review,
  Create PR, and Agent Implement, including To Issues spec-to-slice creation and
  the dependency graph, Issue Triage current-ticket readiness repair,
  verified-state reconciliation, configured intake-to-ready promotion,
  Orchestrator-owned
  active tracker transitions, the orchestrator integrate gate and friction intake,
  clean-context review delegation, and the implementation pipeline
- review gates: code review, Agent Review, local GitHub review submission actor
  and CLI policy, hosted bot review escalation, configured provider such as
  CodeRabbit or Cursor Bugbot, provider auto-review mode and trigger policy,
  required CI, preview checks
- environment safety: local, development, preview, and production capabilities;
  production deploy path; preview deploy path; credential rules; allowed hosted
  checks; and explicit approval requirements
- instruction trust boundaries: trusted policy sources, untrusted work context,
  and what to do when tracker, PR, log, worker, or external-doc text tries to
  override workflow policy
- handoff shape for implementation, review, queue, and PR creation
- unknowns that still require human input

## Issue Tracker Defaults

Find the repo's issue tracker source of truth before writing labels or statuses.
Use live tracker metadata, tracker workflow settings, existing repo docs, or
explicit user instruction. Do not guess from memory.

Use [references/issue-tracker-contract.md](references/issue-tracker-contract.md)
only when the repo has no different verified mapping. Treat these labels as
defaults, not proof that the tracker already has them:

Kind (single-select; skills enforce exclusivity; only `kind-slice` is
dispatchable):

- `kind-spec`
- `kind-epic`
- `kind-slice`

Readiness:

- `needs-triage`
- `needs-info`
- `ready-for-agent`
- `ready-for-human`
- `wontfix`

Readiness label policy belongs in repo config. By default, `ready-for-agent`
means the ticket needs no further human refinement before handoff to an
implementation agent. It does not mean unblocked, startable, or assigned to a
specific worker environment. Remove it when the ticket moves to the configured
done state.

Readiness-label queries for `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, or equivalent
human/agent attention queues must exclude the configured done state by default.
Do not rely on Done tickets having already had stale readiness labels removed.

Worker environment labels, such as `remote-worker` or `remote-cursor`, are
project config values only. Record them when the repo's tracker uses them; do not
add them as shared defaults. By default, a worker environment label means the
issue is approved to run in that configured environment. It does not mean
unblocked, startable, or implementation-ready.

Risk:

- `risk-normal`
- `risk-security-sensitive`
- `risk-schema`
- `risk-cross-cutting`

These risk labels are dimensions, not severity levels. Add repo-specific risk
labels only when they change routing, checks, approvals, or reviewer assignment.

Review evidence:

- configured exact label slug or ID, such as `code-review-passed`

By default, the review evidence label means the latest linked PR head SHA has
passed the configured code review gate for the ticket. Record the exact
configured label slug or ID, PR URL, and reviewed head SHA when applying it.
Remove it when the PR head changes, blocking findings appear, the linked PR
changes, or the evidence is missing. Resolve the label by configured slug or ID,
not by reconstructing a title-case display name.

Type:

- `Bug`
- `Feature`
- `Improvement`
- `Tech Debt`
- `Spike`
- `Hotfix`

Do not invent a provider location, status, or label if the issue tracker cannot confirm it.
Write an unknown in the config instead.

When tracker tools are available, verify the available tracker metadata during
setup and record exact names plus stable IDs in the config. Later skills should
not have to rediscover routine IDs before moving issues, applying labels, or
checking project state.

Provider location must be query-safe. For Linear, record the team ID and exact
team name or key that the tool accepts. Do not store only a repo slug such as
`agent-paste` unless a read-only tool query proves that slug returns the intended
issues. Record whether the tool uses `status`, `state`, `statusType`, or another
field for workflow filtering.

Do not copy every discoverable agent assignee or integration detail into config.
The tracker remains the source of truth for which agents are currently
assignable. Record only the supported worker delegation paths and repo-specific
routing or continuation details that a future Orchestrator run would otherwise waste
time rediscovering.

Do not verify issue-assigned agents by mutating real implementation issues. Use
read-only tracker metadata, existing verified config, provider documentation, or
a user-approved test issue. If the tracker returns a stable delegate or agent ID
from a real delegation event, record it during refresh so future Orchestrator
runs can use it without probing.

If `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` or a similar label doc exists, update it to
match the config or replace its contents with a pointer to the config. Do not
leave it as a stale partial list. It must cover readiness, risk, review
evidence, type, and any configured area or ownership labels.

## Adapter Update

After writing the config, update short agent adapters when present:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- editor or agent rules
- repo-local skill usage docs

Adapters should say to read `docs/agents/workflow/config.md` before using the
workflow skills. Keep them short and use
[references/agent-workflow.md](references/agent-workflow.md) as the adapter
contract.

If runtime-generated shared `ziw-*` skill files exist under `.agents/skills/`,
`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, or `skills/`, decide whether those files
are a committed dependency, symlink fanout, ignored local cache, absent, or
repo-authored project-specific skills. For committed dependencies, record the
source and lockfile and commit mechanical updates. Never hand-edit downstream
generated copies.

For Claude Code, configure the target repo's Claude Code integration, not this
skills repo. Treat that integration as the source of truth for Claude-facing
agent, command, and skill registration. Configure it to import the target repo's
agent markdown, usually `AGENTS.md` through a one-line `CLAUDE.md` `@AGENTS.md`
import when supported. Claude Code is picky, so do not make independent copies.
Symlink repo-local Claude Code paths into the integration location when Claude
Code requires exact paths, then verify each link target resolves from a clean
checkout. Record any path Claude Code refuses to follow as an unknown instead of
guessing.

## Safety

- Never include secrets, tokens, signed URLs, customer payloads, or private logs
  in the config.
- Never deploy or mutate production while setting up config.
- Prefer exact discovered commands over guesses.
- If a command is inferred but unverified, mark it as inferred.

## Done

Report:

- config path written
- whether this was first setup or refresh of an existing config
- whether the config is complete enough to be the workflow lookup table
- config fields changed, unchanged, and still unknown
- verification evidence gathered and critical unknowns remaining
- commands discovered
- tracker routing and labels found or missing
- agent adapters updated
- unknowns left for the user
- validation command run
