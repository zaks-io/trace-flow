# Agent Implement

Implement exactly one issue as one scoped PR. Own the whole path from assigned
work through PR creation unless blocked by missing credentials or permissions.

## Inputs

- One tracker issue ID or URL, or a worker assignment that names one issue.
- Repo path, branch, and agent access constraints from
  `docs/agents/workflow/config.md`.
- Required checks and acceptance criteria from the issue.

## Context

Read first:

- `docs/agents/workflow/config.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CONTEXT.md`
- linked tracker issue body, comments, labels, dependencies, and attachments
- docs named by the issue
- changed package or app README/context docs

If config is missing, infer minimally and report that `workflow-setup` is needed.

## Claim

Start only when the issue:

- belongs to the configured tracker location
- is unblocked
- is scoped to one PR
- has `ready-for-agent`
- has any project-configured worker environment label or field required for the
  selected delegation path
- has enough acceptance criteria and required checks to verify

For issue-assigned agents, the claim should come from the configured issue
tracker assignment. Do not treat a local CLI with the same brand name as the
issue-tracker integration.

When starting:

- confirm Agent Orchestrator moved or delegated the issue to `In Progress`
- assign yourself or record the delegate when supported
- comment with the short plan
- use or create a branch containing the issue ID

If invoked directly outside Agent Orchestrator, do not move workflow state unless the
repo config or user explicitly delegates that authority. Otherwise report the
needed claim transition for Agent Orchestrator.

Stop on missing product, security, credential, provider, ADR, customer, or
production approval decisions.

## Implement

- Stay inside the issue scope.
- Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Follow existing repo patterns and package boundaries.
- Update tests, docs, generated artifacts, and status ledgers only when the
  behavior contract changed or the issue requires it.
- Create follow-up tracker issues for adjacent work instead of broadening scope.
- Never deploy production, rotate secrets, or mutate live customer data without
  explicit approval.

## Implementation Pipeline

Treat implementation, code review, and PR creation as one pipeline:

1. Implement the scoped change.
2. Run focused checks while iterating.
3. Run the issue's required checks.
4. Run `workflow-code-review`.
5. Fix blocking findings and rerun relevant checks.
6. Repeat code review until the verdict is `READY FOR PR`, or stop on a
   blocker that needs human input.
7. Run `workflow-create-pr` to commit, push, create or update the PR, and update
   the issue tracker. Tell Create PR whether the latest code review covers the
   current diff.

Do not hand off after code changes alone. A completed Agent Implement run should
end with a PR or a clear reason the PR could not be created.

## Verify

Run the issue's required checks first, then the configured full local gate unless
a narrower gate is justified. Use focused checks while iterating.

If hosted verification is required but not authorized or unavailable, stop and
report the gap. Do not mark acceptance criteria complete on partial evidence.

## Review And PR

Use `workflow-code-review` as the implementation quality gate. Then use
`workflow-create-pr` as the shipping gate. `workflow-create-pr` may rerun code
review, but Agent Implement should still run it before PR creation so review
feedback is handled while the implementation context is fresh.

Remote workers should not create another worktree. Continue on the assigned
branch and PR for review fixes.

Issue-assigned agents should receive fixes and PR process feedback where the
tracker integration continues the same session, usually the same issue comments
unless config says otherwise.

## Changes Requested

When resuming:

- read PR comments, failed checks, issue context, and config again
- address only requested changes and directly required tests/docs
- push fixes to the same PR
- comment with what changed and checks rerun
- report that the issue is ready to return to `In Review` for Agent Orchestrator

## Done

Report:

- issue ID and branch
- PR URL or reason no PR exists
- files changed
- checks run and result
- code review verdict
- whether code review covers the current diff
- tracker comments and status handoff
- blockers or follow-up issues
